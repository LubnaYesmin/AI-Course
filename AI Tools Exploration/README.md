   > "Create a presentation on my AI course, covering theory topics like logic, CSP, and machine learning, along with lab algorithms like A*, DFS, and Min-Max."
4. Gamma generated auto-filled slides which I then:
   - Edited to fit my course structure
   - Rewrote slide content using my handwritten notes
   - Added headings like: *Search Algorithms, Logic, Game Algorithms, ML, etc.*
