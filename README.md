# ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

## 🤖 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Course – Full Overview

Welcome to the comprehensive summary of my Artificial Intelligence (AI) course!This repository contains my theoretical notes, lab implementations, and project-based learning outcomes from a 6-month academic course on AI.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Course

The primary aim of this course was to build a strong foundation in artificial intelligence by exploring both classical and modern techniques in problem-solving, knowledge representation, logic, and machine learning.
Students were encouraged to think algorithmically, solve real-world problems using intelligent techniques, and understand the core principles that drive AI today.

## 📘 What I Learned

The course was structured into two parts:🔹 Theory Topics for foundational understanding🔹 Lab Topics for hands-on algorithm design and implementation

🧠 Lab + Theory Topics (Implemented and Studied)
These topics involved both theoretical analysis and practical implementation using programming (typically in Python or pseudocode):

🔍 Search Algorithms
       -- Breadth-First Search (BFS): Explores all nodes at the current depth before moving to the next level.
       -- Depth-First Search (DFS): Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
       -- Iterative Deepening Search: Combines DFS’s space-efficiency and BFS’s completeness by gradually increasing depth.
       -- Depth-Limited Search: DFS with a predefined depth limit to avoid infinite traversal.-- Bidirectional Search: Runs BFS from both the start and goal nodes simultaneously to meet in the middle.
       
🌟 Heuristic-Based Search
       -- Best-First Search: Uses a heuristic to prioritize the most promising node.
       -- A Algorithm:* Combines cost from start and estimated cost to goal for optimal pathfinding.
       -- AO Algorithm:* Used for AND-OR graphs, handling complex decision-making trees.
       
🧗 Hill Climbing and Beam Search
       -- Hill Climbing: Moves in the direction of increasing value (greedy ascent) until a peak is reached.
       -- Beam Search: A variant of BFS that only keeps the most promising k paths at each depth.
       
🕹️ Game Playing Algorithms
      -- Min-Max Algorithm: Decision-making algorithm for two-player games by minimizing possible loss.
      -- Alpha-Beta Pruning: Optimized version of Min-Max to eliminate branches that won’t affect the outcome.
      
📚 Theory-Only Topics
      These were conceptual and problem-solving oriented topics that provided a theoretical backbone for intelligent systems:

✅ Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)
      Solving problems by satisfying a set of constraints (e.g., map coloring, sudoku).

🧩 Classic AI Problems
     -- Job Scheduling Problem: Assigning tasks to resources under constraints.
     -- Cryptarithmetic Puzzle: Solving letter-based arithmetic with digit assignments.

🧠 Consistency and Backtracking
    -- Local Consistency & Bound Propagation: Reducing domains of variables before full backtracking.
    -- Backtracking Algorithms: Recursive search methods for CSPs with constraint violation checking.

🧠 Knowledge Representation and Reasoning
    -- Propositional Logic: Representing knowledge using propositions and logical operations.
       Logic Laws:
             Commutative Law
             Associative Law
             Distributive Law
             Identity and Domination Laws
             De Morgan’s Laws
       Normal Forms:
             Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)
             Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF)
       Predicate Logic: Introduction to quantifiers, variables, and relations.

🌿 Optimization Algorithms
      -- Branch and Bound Algorithm: Efficient search for optimal solutions by pruning suboptimal branches.
      -- 0/1 Knapsack Problem: Selecting items with max value under a weight limit using dynamic programming or greedy heuristics.

🤖 Introduction to Machine Learning
      -- We explored foundational ML concepts in the context of AI decision-making:

📈 Learning Types
      -- Supervised Learning: Learning from labeled datasets to make future predictions.
      -- Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in data without labels (e.g., clustering).
      -- Reinforcement Learning: Agents learn by interacting with the environment and maximizing rewards.
      
🏷️ Data Concepts
     -- Labeled vs Unlabeled Data: Core to distinguishing between supervised and unsupervised techniques.
     
     Real-life Applications:
     Weather Forecasting: Using historical data for prediction.
     Robot Behavior Control: Learning action strategies via reward maximization.

📊 Probabilistic Reasoning
     -- Bayesian  Networks: Represent probabilistic relationships among variables.
     -- Likelihood Weight Sampling: A method for approximate inference in Bayesian networks.

🗣️ NLP & Robotics
     -- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Basics of understanding and generating human language.
     -- Robotics: Application of AI for pathfinding, control, and environment interaction.
